# preprocess_bridges_and_tunnels()
#
# Convert NVDB bridges and tunnels into OSM tags.
#
#  - The NVDB bridge/tunnel data has a considerable amount of errors
#      - Missing bridges, especially for cycleway
#      - Sometimes incorrect tags (bridge that should be under passage etc)
#      - Some alignment errors of under passages missing the bridge above
#      - Sometimes bridges are off by ~100 meters (rare?).
#      - Errors are more prominent in city areas like Stockholm with many long bridges and tunnels,
#        in rural areas the data is often mostly correct
#
#  - It's not possible to resolve the "layer" tag for OSM data. If the NVDB data would be 100%
#    correct it would be possible to make good educated guesses with an advanced algorithm. However
#    as the data is not that good and multi-layer bridges are rare, we've not made an algoritm for
#    that, a fix me tag is added instead when crossing bridges and tunnels are detected.
#
#  - OSM mapping tradition is to map a cycleway/footway that passes under a street as a tunnel,
#    even when the construction is technically a short bridge. In NVDB this is mapped as överfart
#    on the street and underfart on the cycleway. This is resolved here, converting to the OSM
#    mapping tradition.

# Info not used and why:
#   väghållare / road maintainer:
#     - forest companies also maintain roads that we want to tag service
#     - in many municipalities all väghållare is just the same for 8/9, "enskild" with no further

#   tillgänglighetsklass / availability class (NVDB-Tillganglighet A,B,C,D):
#     - actual value has quirky contents in forestry network, many roads at a higher class than it
#       should be
#     - however if the value exists or not is a lead, value doesn't exist on driveways, unfortunately
#       it's quite often missing also on some forestry roads and other tracks as well
